CHANGELOG:

Todo:
	- nooblib:
		- rename "runScript"; add "nsl_" prefix for nsl functions
		- gui for settings
		- create nsl function who results the path to the dir in with the script, who call the function, is saved
		- creating solution that the script itself don't need to know his name, maybe scripts need to have a init function, which gets called one time after execute by the nooblib, and the nooblib give the script via this function his name
		- use =s and !=s instead of strcmp
		- add list functions
		- also add option to execute non-default scripts from the root user sauer directory as outlaw scripts, default disable
		
		- maybe find a solution how to loop only over directories?
		
	- noobauth:
		- find solution how to check if /setmaster 1 is possible
		
	- noobafk:
		- problem if you are in the "afk"-state and disconnect. solution: remove "afk"-state if you disconnect (no matter if youself doing it or the server disconnect you)
