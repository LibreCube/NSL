CHANGELOG:

Todo:
	- nooblib:
		- rename "runScript"; add "nsl_" prefix for nsl functions
		- gui for settings
		- create nsl function who results the path to the dir in with the script, who call the function, is saved
		- creating solution that the script itself don't need to know his name, maybe scripts need to have a init function, which gets called one time after execute by the nooblib, and the nooblib give the script via this function his name

		- add list function

		- find solution how to check if /setmaster 1 is possible
