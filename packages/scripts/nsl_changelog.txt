CHANGELOG:

Todo:
	- nooblib:
		- gui for settings
		- create nsl function who results the path to the dir in with the script, who call the function, is saved
		- creating solution that the script itself don't need to know his name, maybe scripts need to have a init function, which gets called one time after execute by the nooblib, and the nooblib give the script via this function his name
		- also add option to execute non-default scripts from the root user sauer directory as outlaw scripts, default disable
		- make sure no errors come up even when there arent settings for the script (scripts HAVE to have the default settings, and NSL needs an API who can handle that problem)!
		- default enabled state
		- name/title of scripts
		- cubescript grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr: 	justatest = "true"; guicheckbox "" justatest "true" "false" [ echo actioncall; ]
			will NOT give you a checked checkbox. only when justatest = 1. so why the hell can i change on/off values when they are getting ignored at init?
		- list function: 
			- supports "local" mode auch in save und delete
			- make handle of nested lists easier something like (nListGetValue list [key1 key2]) = list[key1][key2])
		
		- maybe find a solution how to loop only over directories?
		- solution: do im running on sauer or tesseract? (maybe with detection for other cube games also, but no need)
		
	- noobauth:
		- find solution how to check if /setmaster 1 is possible
		
	- noobafk:
		- also check if connecting to another server (the check if you disconnected will likely dont trigger because you reconnect a way to fast)
			=> auto afk undo
			
	- noobexplain
		- update content
		- maybe check if txt's are too long before sending
		
Todo after 1.0:
	- nooblib:
		- "garbage collector": remove setting from files which don't exist anymore
	
	- noobafk:
		- eliminate the need for a restart after a key change
