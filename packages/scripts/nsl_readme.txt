Readme of the Nooby's Script Library (short: NSL)

How can I install and use this script library?
	First thanks to give it a try!
	
	To install the library you have to copy all files into the sauerbraten user directory.
	The only file which will get overwritten is your autoexec.cfg.
	So if you have never change something in your autoexec.cfg file everything is fine and you can just overwrite it.
	
	If you have authkeys for server to claim master/admin you can create a authkeys.cfg and put them all in.
	The authkeys.cfg file will get execute from the script library.
	
	If you have other stuff in your autoexec.cfg which you want to use in the future, you have to copy this stuff in the new autoexec.cfg
	or you copy it into your authkeys.cfg too. The last possibility makes it easier to update the NSL, because you don't have to copy your
	personal stuff again and again into the autoexec.cfg.
	
How can I update the NSL?
	First make sure you have a backup your personal stuff, then delete the old packages/scripts directory and then copy the new files into your sauerbraten dir.
	
How can I report bugs or make suggestions?
	If you see this noob called "Nooby" in game just talk to him. He won't blame you. Really.
